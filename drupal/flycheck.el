;; Enable drupal-mode support for flycheck and phpcs.

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)
(require 'drupal/phpcs)

(defun drupal/flycheck-hook ()
  "Enable drupal-mode support for flycheck."
  (when (and drupal-mode drupal/phpcs-standard)
    ;; Set the coding standard to "Drupal" (phpcs.el has checked that
    ;; it's supported).
    (set (make-local-variable 'flycheck-phpcs-standard) drupal/phpcs-standard)

    ;; Flycheck will also highlight trailing whitespace as an
    ;; error so no need to highlight it twice.
    (when (fboundp 'drupal/phpcs-dont-show-trailing-whitespace)
      (drupal/phpcs-dont-show-trailing-whitespace))))

(add-hook 'drupal-mode-hook #'drupal/flycheck-hook)

(flycheck-define-checker drupal-phpcs
  "Check non-PHP Drupal files using PHP_CodeSniffer.

The Drupal standard includes checks for non-PHP files, this
checker runs those.

  ;; Though phpcs supports Checkstyle output which we could feed to
  ;; `flycheck-parse-checkstyle', we are still using error patterns here,
  ;; because PHP has notoriously unstable output habits.  See URL
  ;; `https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck/issues/78' and URL
  ;; `https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck/issues/118'
