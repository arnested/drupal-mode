1 Drupal Mode
*************

Drupal Mode is an advanced minor mode for developing in Drupal.

   Drupal Mode is based on top of PHP mode and defines among other
things indentation etc. to match Drupal Coding Standards.

1.1 Mission statement
=====================

   * Don't over do it
        * Only provide what makes sense in standard Emacs fashion.

        * Leave out what is considered personal taste.

        * Provide optional stuff if in doubt.

        * ... or provide option to disable if the personal taste is
          considered good practice.

        * The rest can go as advice on EmacsWiki or github wiki or
          g.d.o.

   * Lets base this on Emacs 24 - to do it simple, backporting can come
     later.

   * Do the right thing in all relevant major modes:
        * php-mode

        * javascript mode(s)

        * conf-mode (module.info)

   * Provide the mode via ELPA.

1.2 Installation
================

The easiest way to install Drupal Mode is probably to install it via
the ELPA archive at Marmalade (http://marmalade-repo.org).
